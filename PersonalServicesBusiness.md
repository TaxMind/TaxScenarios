# Personal Services Business

Personal Services Business, or PSB for short, or "incorporated employee", is a concept in tax law that defines business relationship where a person is getting paid as a consultant, but performing the work as an employee.  A worker who participates in this type of scheme needs to pay higher income tax rate for the money that is left in the corporation, and only a very limited set of deductions are allowed.  It's meant to discourage this type of business arrangements. 

But if you know how to properly manage your PSB status, is it better or worse than being an employee? 
 
Let's work it out with Tim, a young software engineer who is currently on the job market. 
Tim has had 2 interviews recently, and both have offered him a placement. 
One job is permanent, with an annual salary of $120K. Tim also gets employee benefits, such as medical and dental insurance, RRSP match (up to $1K/year, for the first 3 years of employment), and 3 weeks of paid vacation
Second job is a 12-month contract, paying the rate of $75/hour. 
Taking into consideration only the financial factors, which job should Tim choose?

### As an employee of another business:
 Tim doesn't have to do any pre-job setup. He just needs to show up at the office on his first day, fill out some paperwork given to him by his manager and start working.
In that paperwork, Tim will specify how much income tax does he wants to take off his paycheque, and his SIN number. 
The accounting department at his new company will take over and provide Tim with his salary payments, payment stubs and T4s at the end of the tax year.

### As a contractor (incorporated employee):
 Tim will have to do few things to get himself set up for this arrangement. 
He will have to:
1) Register a corporation in order to take this job. That will cost him anywhere from $200 (federal), $550 (provincial) or more, and about an hour of his time
2) Create a business account with CRA for his new corporation (with this, he will get CRA business, GST/HST and a payroll account numbers)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to [CRA website](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/registering-your-business/register.html)
3) Open the business bank account  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would look to credit union to open my bank account, as they do not charge monthly fees. Otherwise, do I want to be paying upwards of $10/month?
4) [Start paying yourself a salary](####-4.-start-paying-yourself-a-salary) (see below for details)
5) Prepare, pay and file for various tax liabilities/returns: GST/HST, payroll, income tax returns:
