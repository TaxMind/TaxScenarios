# Personal Services Business

Personal Services Business, or PSB for short, or "incorporated employee", is a concept in tax law that defines business relationship where a person is getting paid as a consultant, but performing the work as an employee.  A worker who participates in this type of scheme needs to pay higher income tax rate for the money that is left in the corporation, and only a very limited set of deductions are allowed.  It's meant to discourage this type of business arrangements. 

But if you know how to properly manage your PSB status, is it better or worse than being an employee? 
 
Let's work it out with Tim, a young software engineer who was on the job market in Dec 2020. 
Tim had 2 interviews then, and both have offered him a placement. 
One job was permanent, with an annual salary of $120K. Tim was also to get employee benefits, such as medical and dental insurance, RRSP match (up to $1K/year, for the first 3 years of employment), and 3 weeks of paid vacation
Second job was a 12-month contract, paying the rate of $75/hour. 
Taking into consideration only the financial factors, which job should Tim have choosen?

### As an employee of another business:
 Tim doesn't have to do any pre-job setup. He just needs to show up at the office on his first day, fill out some paperwork given to him by his manager and start working.
In that paperwork, Tim will specify how much income tax does he wants to take off his paycheque, and his SIN number. 
The accounting department at his new company will take over and provide Tim with his salary payments, payment stubs and T4s at the end of the tax year.

### As a contractor (incorporated employee):
 Tim will have to do few things to get himself set up for this arrangement. 
He will have to:
1) Register a corporation in order to take this job. That will cost him anywhere from $200 (federal), $550 (provincial) or more, and about an hour of his time
2) Create a business account with CRA for his new corporation (with this, he will get CRA business, GST/HST and a payroll account numbers)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to [CRA website](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/registering-your-business/register.html)
3) Open the business bank account  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would look to credit union to open my bank account, as they do not charge monthly fees. Otherwise, do I want to be paying upwards of $10/month?
4) [Start paying yourself a salary](####-4.-start-paying-yourself-a-salary) (see below for details)
5) Prepare, pay and file for various tax liabilities/returns: GST/HST, payroll, income tax returns:

#### 4. Start paying yourself a salary
Each month in 2021, Tim worked 4 weeks, 40 hours each week, for a total of 160 hours per month. 
With the hourly rate of %75/hour, Tim billed his client $12,000 + 13% HST (Ontario) = $13,560 each month through his corporation. 
##### Sales Tax: 
$1,560** of HST each month he will have to remit to the government. 
It is the money that is being temporarily held on by Tim's corporation until the GST/HST is required to be paid (Tim does that through his online corporate banking account)

##### Salary:
When calculating Tim's salary, Tim needs to keep in mind that the corporation has to match his (personal) CPP withholding, up to a maximum of $3,166.45/year (that is the maximum assuming his annual salary earnings is a minimum of $61,600).  

**note: for a 100% owner-shareholder, EI is not deductible from the salary of their corporation, so Tim's corporation does not need to match his EI deductions and therefore, they are not included**  

If Tim is billing $12,000/month + HST through his corporation and wants to pay the maximum out to himself in salary, then his annual salary of $144,000 (12 * $12,000) will be reduced by the max employee portion of CPP withholdings, which is $3,166.45.  
As well, the corporation must remit an additional $3,166.45 of CPP for the employer portion of CPP. 
The corporation will get a deduction for the $3,166.45 of the employer portion of CPP remitted to CRA when calculating income on the corporate tax return.
The impact on Tim’s salary will be a reduction to $140,834. 
Tim will include this salary of $140,834 on his personal tax return, but $3,166.45 of the salary will be remitted for the employee portion of CPP rather than paid to him. 
He will receive deductions and tax credits on his personal tax return for the employee portion of CPP of $3,166 that will have been withheld from the $140,834 salary and remitted by the corporation to CRA.   

In addition, it is important to realize that the corporation is also required to withhold and remit income tax from the salary payments to Tim.  
The income tax withheld is a prepayment of Tim’s personal tax on his salary that will be applied against his tax liability when he files his personal tax return for the year.  
The overall result is that the amount Tim receives of the $12,000 earned each month will be net of the employer CPP paid by the corporation and also the employee CPP and income tax withheld and remitted by the corporation on Tim’s behalf. 
 
##### Deductions: 
Through his corporation, apart from the salary, Tim can also deduct benefits that he would otherwise receive from an employer. 
Example are: health + dental insurance, or professional general liability/errors & omissions insurance premiums paid for him by his corporation.
If Tim's work as an employee would provide other allowances, they would be deductible as well eg. a car allowance. 
If Tim incurs expenses for selling properties, or negotiating contracts, those expenses might be deductible. 
Last, if Tim has to pay any legal fees/expenses to collect amounts owed to him for services rendered, those legal fees/expenses are also deductible (let's hope there will be none of those). 
Any other expense is not deductible for Tim through his personal services business corporation.

When we say the expense is deductible, it means that the corporation is able to reduce the amount of income it has earned by the amount of the expense. 
Therefore, the corporation pays less in income tax. 
Also, the amount of GST/HST** remitted to the government for his billings can be reduced by the amount GST/HST the corporation pays for expenses. 

For a simple example, let's say Tim’s corporation has purchased $1,000 + HST of professional liability insurance for his work. 
That expense is deductible, and his corporate income will be reduced by $1,000 when calculating the corporation’s income for tax purposes on the corporate tax return. 
If Tim is using regular method for GST/HST return filings for the corporation, the amount of HST he has to pay to the GST/HST gods can be reduced by $130.
