# Personal Services Business

Personal Services Business, or PSB for short, or "incorporated employee", is a concept in tax law that defines business relationship where a person is getting paid as a consultant, but performing the work as an employee.  A worker who participates in this type of scheme needs to pay higher income tax rate for the money that is left in the corporation, and only a very limited set of deductions are allowed.  It's meant to discourage this type of business arrangements. 

But if you know how to properly manage your PSB status, is it better or worse than being an employee? 
 
Let's work it out with Tim, a young software engineer who is currently on the job market. 
Tim has had 2 interviews recently, and both have offered him a placement. 
One job is permanent, with an annual salary of $120K. Tim also gets employee benefits, such as medical and dental insurance, RRSP match (up to $1K/year, for the first 3 years of employment), and 3 weeks of paid vacation
Second job is a 12-month contract, paying the rate of $75/hour. 
Taking into consideration only the financial factors, which job should Tim choose?
